# Pomodoro Timer
Welcome to my Pomodoro Timer project! This is a simple productivity tool that helps users track their work and break times using the Pomodoro Technique.

## Features
- Start, pause, and reset timer
- Display remaining time and session type (work or break)

## Technologies
This project was built using React and was bootstrapped with create-react-app.
